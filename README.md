3d_plot_animation  
  
We generate a 3D ellipsoid then use matplotlib Axes3D to project in 3D perspective  
The perspective plots are generated sequentially for a range of angles around X  
Each file is saved to a png with a sequential name  
  
moviepy is then used to turn the sequence of png files into an animation
